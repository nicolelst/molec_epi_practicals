    > Since miRNA regulation is dependent on sequence complementarity, it follows that variation in either the mRNA or miRNA sequence will have significant effects. The most critical region for complementarity is the seed region (nucleotides 2â€“7 from the 5'-terminus of the miRNA).

mmu-mir-196a, etc.) 
 
#### B. Which strand of hsa-miR-196a (3p or 5p) is expressed at higher levels based on deep sequencing?
